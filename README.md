<!-- #region introduction -->

Typescript oauth library for the [V2 Patreon API](https://docs.patreon.com/) with:

- Support for Creator access tokens and oauth tokens
- Client with methods for calling every endpoint, both resource and webhook endpoints
- Methods to create a webhook server
- Typescript types that strongly reflect your query for raw or simplified responses

```ts
const query = QueryBuilder.campaign
    .setAttributes({ campaign: ['patron_count'] })

const payload = await client.fetchCampaign('campaign_id', query)
    // ^? { data: { attributes: { patron_count: number } }, ... }
const campaign = await client.simplified.fetchCampaign('campaign_id', query)
    // ^? { patronCount: number, id: string, type: Type.Campaign }
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install patreon-api.ts
pnpm add patreon-api.ts
yarn add patreon-api.ts
```

## Usage

<details>
<summary>Supported Patreon api: v2</summary>

<!-- #region api-versions -->
The default API version for this package is `2` and might change in major versions.

> [!CAUTION]
> This package does not include v1 of the Patreon API and starts with [API v2](https://docs.patreon.com/#apiv2-oauth). The sections in the Patreon documentation are prefixed by `APIv2:`. The Oauth flow, introduction and [sections below sorting](https://docs.patreon.com/#pagination-and-sorting) are related to all versions.

When the default API version is changed, old versions will still receive updates.
You can not import this module by API version since it is unlikely that Patreon will release a new version any time soon.
